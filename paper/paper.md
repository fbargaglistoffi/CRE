# Summary

In health and social sciences, it is critically important to identify interpretable subgroups of the study population where a treatment has notable heterogeneity in the causal effects with respect to the average treatment effect (ATE). Several approaches have already been proposed for heterogenous treatment effect (HTE) discovery, either estimating first the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) and identifying heterogeneous subgroups in a second stage [@foster2011subgroup; @bargagli2020heterogeneous; @hahn2020bayesian; @bargagli2022heterogeneous], either in a direct data-driven procedure [@wang2022causal; @nagpal2020interpretable]. Many of these methodologies are decision tree-based methodologies. Decision tree approaches are based on efficient and easily implementable recursive mathematical programming (e.g., HTE maximization), they can be easily tweaked and adapted to different scenarios depending on the research question of interest, and they guarantee a high degree of interpretability---i.e., the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision [@lakkaraju2016interpretable]. Despite these appealing features, single-tree heterogeneity discovery is characterized by two main limitations: instability in the identification of the subgroups and reduced exploration of the potential heterogeneity. To accommodate these shortcomings, @bargagli2023causal proposed Causal Rule Ensemble, a new method for interpretable HTE characterization in terms of decision rules, via an extensive exploration of heterogeneity patterns by an ensemble-of-trees approach, enforcing high stability in the discovery. `CRE` is an R package providing a flexible implementation of Causal Rule Ensemble.

# Statement of Need

Several methodologies for HTE estimation have already been proposed (together with the release of the corresponding packages), but the interpretable discovery of the subgroups and the key factors driving the HTE is still an open challenge. The package `causalTree`, based on Causal Honest Tree [@athey2016], implements a methodology for interpretable HTE discovery and estimation via decision rules. Still, despite its appealing features, it is also characterized by the main limitations of decision tree-based methods. Firstly, single-tree-based subgroup identification is sensitive to variations in the training sample (high model variance)---e.g., if the data are slightly altered, a completely different set of discovered subgroups might be found [@breiman1996heuristics; @hastie2009elements; @kuhn2013applied]. Secondly, it may fail to explore a vast number of potential subgroups (limited subgroup exploration)---e.g., the subgroups discovered are just the ones that can be represented by a single tree [@kuhn2013applied; @spanbauer2021nonparametric]. To illustrate, consider a scenario in which two distinct factors independently contribute to the heterogeneity in treatment effects. In such cases, a single tree algorithm may detect only one of these factors, failing to identify the second. In instances where both factors are identified, they are detected sub-optimally as an interaction between the two variables rather than as distinct drivers of the treatment heterogeneity. To account for these shortcomings, we propose `CRE`, an R package providing a flexible implementation of the Causal Rule Ensemble algorithm. `CRE` provides (i) an interpretable representation of the HTE in observational studies, (ii) via an extensive exploration of complex heterogeneity patterns using decision rules, while (iii) guaranteeing high stability in the discovery. 

# Algorithm

Causal Rule Ensemble relies on the Treatment Effect linear decomposition assumption, characterizing the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) by $M+1$ distinct contributions:
$$\tau(\boldsymbol{x}) = \mathbb{E}[\tau_i | X_i=\boldsymbol{x}] = \bar{\tau} + \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m \cdot r_m(\boldsymbol{x})$$
where $\bar{\tau}$ is the ATE, and for each $m$ in $\{1,..., M\}$, $r_m$ is an interpretable decision rule characterizing a specific subset of the covariate space, and $\alpha_m$ is the corresponding Additive Average Treatment Effect (AATE).
`CRE` procedure is divided into two steps, discovery and estimation, and each observation is used for only one of the two steps (honest splitting).
During the discovery step, `CRE` retrieves the $M$ decision rules characterizing the heterogeneity in the treatment effect. A set of candidate decision rules is extracted by an ensemble of trees trained by a _fit-the-fit_ procedure to model some Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimates, and among these, only a simple and robust subset of rules is selected for the linear decomposition by the Stability Selection algorithm via LASSO.
During the estimation step, `CRE` estimates the ATE and AATEs, by the normal equations to model some ITE estimates. Different ITE estimators can be selected for each step.


# Usage

`CRE` is available both on CRAN [@cre_r] and [GitHub](https://github.com/NSAPH-Software/CRE) and can be installed and loaded into the R session
using:
```R
install.packages("CRE")
library("CRE")
```

`generate_cre_dataset()` is a flexible synthetic dataset generator, which can be used for simulations before applying `CRE` to real-world observational data sets. 
```R
dataset <- generate_cre_dataset(n = 2000, 
                                rho = 0, 
                                n_rules = 4, 
                                p = 10,
                                effect_size = 2, 
                                binary_covariates = TRUE,
                                binary_outcome = FALSE,
                                confounding = "no")
y <- dataset$y
z <- dataset$z
X <- dataset$X
```

We propose here three examples of how to run the Causal Rule Esemble algorithm by the `CRE` package.

**Example 1.** Running Causal Rule Ensemble with default parameters described in @bargagli2023causal.
```R
cre_results <- cre(y, z, X)
```

**Example 2.** Running Causal Rule Ensemble with customized ITE estimator.
```R
ite_pred <- ... # personalized ite estimation
cre_results <- cre(y, z, X, ite = ite_pred)
```

**Example 3.** Running Causal Rule Ensemble with customized parameters.
```R
method_params <- list(ratio_dis = 0.25,
                      ite_method_dis="aipw",
                      ps_method_dis = "SL.xgboost",
                      oreg_method_dis = "SL.xgboost",
                      ite_method_inf = "aipw",
                      ps_method_inf = "SL.xgboost",
                      oreg_method_inf = "SL.xgboost")

hyper_params <- list(intervention_vars = c("x1","x2","x3","x4"),
                     offset = NULL,
                     ntrees_rf = 20,
                     ntrees_gbm = 20,
                     node_size = 20,
                     max_nodes = 5,
                     max_depth = 3,
                     t_decay = 0.025,
                     t_ext = 0.025,
                     t_corr = 1,
                     t_pvalue = 0.05,
                     replace = FALSE,
                     stability_selection = TRUE,
                     cutoff = 0.8,
                     pfer = 0.1,
                     penalty_rl = 1)

cre_results <- cre(y, z, X, method_params, hyper_params)
```

The results are collected in an S3 object containing: the number of decision rules extracted at each step (`M`), the `data.frame` of the CATE decomposition estimates with corresponding uncertainty quantification (`CATE`), the list of selected parameters (`method_params` and `hyper_params`), and the predicted ITEs (`ite_pred`). 

`summarize()` and `print()` display a summary of these results, and `plot()` visualizes the CATE decomposition estimates in a range bar plot. Figure 1 reports an example of the proposed results visualization for Example 1. 

![Visualization of Causal Rule Ensemble HTE linear decomposition for Example 1. For each decision rule discovered, the corresponding AATE estimate with 95% confidence interval is reported in a range bar plot. The decision rules are ordered from the most vulnerable (high AATE) to the least, and the ATE is reported on top of the plot.](images/example.pdf)
